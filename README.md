# Adventure.Land

This is my code for [Adventure.Land](https://adventure.land/), an epic indie MMO RPG, where you have to write JavaScript code to fully automate everything that happens. You can check out [Adventure.Land here.](https://adventure.land/) This is the [Youtube Trailer of the game](

The most forbidden thing in any game is to write a bot for it. Here, this IS the game! :)

(This is not my first coding game, I also played [Screepa](https://screeps.com/), and you can [check out my source here](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/Screeps)).
