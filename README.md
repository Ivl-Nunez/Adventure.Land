# Adventure.Land

This is my code for Adventure.Land], an epic indie MMO RPG, where you have to write JavaScript code to fully automate everything that happens. You can check out [Adventure.Land here.](https://adventure.land/) This is the [Youtube Trailer of the game](

The most forbidden thing in any game is to write a bot for it. Here, this IS the game! :)

(This is not my first coding game, I also played [Screeps](https://screeps.com/), and you can [check out my source here](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/Screeps)).

## Getting started

Here are two great guides that will give you an overview over the game:

- [Sin's Guide to life in Adventure Land](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1636142608)
- [FAQ's by Trexnamedtom](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1640326394)

## The Characters

You can use four characters at the same time, I opted for:

- Mage
- Priest
- Ranger
- Merchant

The merchant is the most capable character so far. Most people only use it to sell things on the marketplace.
Mine acts as s support-character for the party, so they don't get interrupted and can keep farming 100% of the time.

## What the code does

This is a work in progress, and things might change. I don't have a high level yet, and can only farm low level enemies.
Once I can go for harder enemies, the code might change.

Here's a list of wha tthe code is capable of so far:

## General

- Hotkeys: To load characters / create a party / stop characters
- Auto-move to the designated farming spot.
- Auto-Farm designated mob's
- Auto-use potions (Heal & mana)
- Auto-Kite enemies. (All characters (Mage, Priest, Ranger) are ranged characters.)
- Characters can go to town, buy potions and bring gold to the bank (Module "goToTown"), but it's deactivated by default, because the merchant takes care of this now.

## Individual characters

- The mage can: auto-attack enemies (farming), energize partymembers, burst enemies
- The Ranger is also capable to auto-attack enemies (farming), he can use the "hunters mark" and he uses the supertshots (higher dps) skill on enemies
- The priest also can farm on it's own, heal partymembers and heal the whole party at once if needed. He can also debuff (curse) enemies
